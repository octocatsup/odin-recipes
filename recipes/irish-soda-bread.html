    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a very basic Irish soda bread made with only 5 ingredients. Irish soda bread is an easy quick bread that
      is made without yeast and is leavened with baking soda.</p>

    <h2>Time ‚è≤</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prep Time: 10 minutes</li>
      <li>Cook Time: 45 minutes</li>
      <li>Total Time: 55 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients üç±</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups (12.75 oz, 357 gr) all-purpose flour (Or a combination of whole wheat & all-purpose flour)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp Morton kosher salt or table salt (use 1 TBSP if using Diamond kosher)</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (2 oz, 56 gr) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cup - 1 2/3 cup (316 ml - 393 ml) buttermilk, cold</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions üìù</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 F (232 C). Line a 4 or 5 quart [Dutch oven](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073Q8DY3F/)
        with parchment paper. If you do not own a Dutch oven, you can bake this on a sheet pan or in a skillet, but it
        will not rise quite as much as it will if you use an enclosed environment.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda until thoroughly combined. Add the
        pieces of cold butter into the bowl and use a pastry blender or a fork to cut the butter through the flour
        mixture.</li>
      <li>Add the buttermilk in slowly and use a rubber spatula to stir until a soft dough forms. You want the mixture
        to be a very soft dough that is almost on the verge of becoming a thick batter. Different varieties of flour are
        more absorbent than others, so this is why a range of liquid is listed.</li>
      <li>Once you have the desired consistency, transfer the dough into the prepared Dutch oven and use the spatula to
        roughly shape it into a disk. Use a sharp knife, or a bench scraper, to score an X into the dough. You want to
        cut very deep, almost all the way to the bottom of the dough.</li>
      <li>Put the lid on the Dutch oven and put it in the oven. Bake at 450 F (232 C) for 35 minutes. Remove the lid of
        the Dutch oven and bake for another 10-12 minutes until the top is a deep golden brown.</li>
      <li>Serve with butter and salt. This bread is best eaten the day of.</li>
